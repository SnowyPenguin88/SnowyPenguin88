## Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a customisable system monitoring tool, which carries a lightweight UI to monitor system hardware
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript and touching up on Python to improve my understanding of the basics
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on beginner-friendly and open-source projects; please keep in mind that I'm still learning.
