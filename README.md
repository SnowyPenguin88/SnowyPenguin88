## Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a customisable system monitoring tool, with a lightweight UI to monitor system resources.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript and touching up on Python to improve my understanding of the basics.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on beginner-friendly and open-source projects; I'm still learning.
